# School-Project
The projects goal is to read a txt file containing a list of grocery items that were purchased, then it has the first option to print out each item once followed by a number representing how many times it was purchased. The second option allows the user to enter a specific item and output how many times that item was purchased. The third option prints out a histogram displaying each item purchased followed the number of times purchased in the form of astericks. (i.e. onions 4 is displayed onions ****) I believe I did particularly well in the first to options as well as communicating between python and C++ overall. I was unable to create a dat file and write to it like it was required for the 3 option or histogram option, so to improve the program I could figure out how to solve this so it works as required. The most challenging part to code was the histogram and creating and writing to a dat file. I was not able to solve this in the amount of time given, however online forums continue to be a help for when I run into problems. The ability to use two languages together is probably the most transferable skill learned from this project. To keep this project readable and transferable all the code is readable and commented to explain everything, also the python code can stand alone and can be used in other projects.
